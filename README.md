# SimpleReverseProxy

# Why
- I needed a https reverse proxy with more complex filtering functionality and nginx and traefik weren't good enough
- to learn a new language I wanted to learn for a long time
- for funnies
- I needed to write tests for my redirecting logic and writing them in a real lang would have made it easier

# How to use

## Not s Standard Service
i dont like working with services i like working with code since it has lsp autocomplete and a compiler while a config has none of that so the way you
to use the service is to pull the code from the repo and edit the `main.scala` file where you will add your middlewares, cors config etc ...

# Features 

## Middlewares 
middlewares are added using the withMiddleware method


## Handlers
for the handler you use the with handler command (note only one handler can be defined and if you add another you will overwrite the original -> todo make it so that if you call withResolver twice in the builder you panic)


## easy to set up

## easy to set up ssl certs
- you have to use the `withSsl()` method
